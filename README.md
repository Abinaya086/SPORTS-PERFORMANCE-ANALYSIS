Description:
This project presents a Sports Performance Analysis System using OpenCV. The system is designed to assist in analyzing player movements and actions in sports footage by processing video frames or images to track motion, detect players, and evaluate performance patterns.

It utilizes basic computer vision techniques such as background subtraction, contour detection, and motion tracking to identify player movement across frames. This analysis can help coaches and analysts review player positioning, speed, and activity zones to improve team strategy and individual performance.

Key functionalities include:
Reading and processing video or image inputs of sports activities.
Detecting and tracking player motion using contour and background subtraction.
Visualizing player movement paths and zones of activity.
Providing insights for performance review and tactical planning.

The project was developed as part of the Naan Mudhalvan Training Program and highlights the real-world application of computer vision in sports analytics and performance optimization.
